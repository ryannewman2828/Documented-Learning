# tail
The head command reads the last few lines from a file(s) if provided or from stdin if not and prints them to stdout.<br>
Some common options for this command are -n <num> to only read and print the first num lines or -c <num> to print the first num bytes.<br>
Another usage is tail with the -f option to get a realtime update of the file as it grows, common for viewing log files.
