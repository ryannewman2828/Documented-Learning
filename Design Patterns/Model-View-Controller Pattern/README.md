# Graphics Demonstration
A simple demonstration of the JFrame and JPanel in Java making use of the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern

## Model-View-Controller Design Pattern
The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern is used to separate an applications core functionality into 3 components, the Model, the View and the Controller. The Model component is responsible for the applications core behaviour, it manages the data and applies application specific logic to it. In a sense the Model is the computational component of the application. The View component is responsible for taking the output generated from the Model and displaying it in the format necessary for the application. The Controller component is responsible for accepting and communicating input to the other components. The Model-View-Controller Pattern adds many advantages to your application such as high cohesion and low coupling. This pattern is also heavily used as a web architecture and is enforced in many popular web frameworks.
