# Response Builder
A program that builds and prints HTTP responses to standard output using Java and The Builder Design Pattern

## Builder Design Pattern
The Builder Design Pattern falls under the set of creational patterns. This pattern allows you to create complex objects from a simple step by step approach. This pattern also allows for variation in the final product using the same construction process. This pattern is used in situations where certain construction steps must happen and others are subject to change at runtime. This pattern is also used to create an immutable object which would normally be too complicated to produce with a constructor.
