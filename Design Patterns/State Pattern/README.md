# Side Scroller Character
A Character that can be used in a side scrolling video game programmed using Java and the State Design Pattern.

## State Design Pattern
The State Design Pattern falls under the set of behavioural patterns. This pattern allows for the behaviour of a class to change depending on the value of an internal state variable. Various subclasses are created to represent each state and they all inherit from a master state object. This pattern can also be used to solve the problem of multiple case statements vectoring the flow of an application based on state. A real world example of this pattern would be a vendoring system that has states based on the inventory, amount of currency deposited to the site and the ability to make purchases.
