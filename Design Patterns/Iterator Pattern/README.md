# Linked List
An Implementation of a simple linked list using Java and The Iterator Design Pattern

## Iterator Design Pattern
The Iterator Design Pattern falls under the set of behavioral patterns. The patterns main purpose is that it allows the programmer to access a collection of object sequentially without having any understanding of the implementation. This results in the seperation of containers and algorithms by allowing a specified type of iterator to be used for traversal instead of a container specific algorithm.
