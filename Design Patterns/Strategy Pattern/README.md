# Robocode Drone
A Robotic tank programmed with the robocode api to fight other tanks in simulated warfare, programmed with the use of the Strategy Design Pattern

## Strategy Design Pattern
The Strategy Design Pattern falls under the set of behavioural patterns. This pattern allows us to create several strategies for which one main object can choose from depending on the runtime context. This allows a family of algorithms to be created and be chosen interchangeably. This pattern is used in things with multiple interchangeable input strategies like an online shopping website that uses both paypal and credit card as its payment strategies.
