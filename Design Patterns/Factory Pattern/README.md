# Currency Symbol Reporter
A simple program that takes in a country as input and prints the symbol of that countries currency using Java and the Factory Design Pattern.

## Factory Design Pattern
The Factory Design Pattern falls underthe set of creational design patterns. This pattern is used when we have a superclass and want to declare different subclasses based on input. This allows for developers to make the creation process more customizable and support more complicated behaviours. This pattern has a factory class that has a static method which takes in input and returns a specific derived class.
