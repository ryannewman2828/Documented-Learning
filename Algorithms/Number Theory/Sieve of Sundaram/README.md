# Sieve of Sundaram
The Sieve of Sundaram is one of the Prime Number Sieves. The algorithm works by continually removing numbers in the form i + j + 2ij from a list. Then it takes this list and doubles and increments the entries to yield a list of prime numbers excluding 2. This algorithm is effecient but clocks in after the Sieve of Eratosthenes and the Sieve of Atkin.
