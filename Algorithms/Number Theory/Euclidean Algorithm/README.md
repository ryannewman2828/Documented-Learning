# Euclidean Algorithm
The Euclidean Algorithm is a method in mathematics for computing the GCD of two numbers. The main principle that this algorithm uses is the GCD of two numbers doesn't change when the larger of the two is replaced by the positive difference of the two numbers. This process is repeaed until a = b = GCD(a, b). This process can also be improved by dividing instead of subtracting and stopping at 0, this reduces the amount of steps taken to be five times the number of digits in the number. The code example showcased in this directory is the improved modulus version. Some of the practical applications of this algorithm include cryptography, breaking cryptosystems, solving Diophantine equations and proving theorems in number theory.
