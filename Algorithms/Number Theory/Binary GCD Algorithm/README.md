# Binary GCD Algorithm
The Binary GCD Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the GCD of two non-negative integers. This algorithm functions with much simple operations than the convention Euclidean and Extended Euclidean Algorithms. This algorithm works by recursively applying some know identites. First it checks to see if one of the numbers is 0 or if the two numbers are equal, then we have found our GCD. If both the numbers are even then GCD(a, b) = 2 * GCD(a / 2, b / 2). If one of these numbers is even whilst the other is odd then that number is divided by two since two is not a common divisor. If both are odd then the Euclidean Algorithm is performed on the numbers. This process is repeated until a GCD is found.
