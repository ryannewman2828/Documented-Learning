# Gauss-Seidel
In linear algebra the Gauss-Seidel Algorithm is used for solving a systems of linear equations with an iterative method. Convergence of the matrix and therefore whether a solution is found is only guarenteed if the matrix is either diagonally dominant, or symmetric and positive definite. The algorithm works by iterating over the equation L<sub>*</sub>x<sup>(k+1)</sup> = b - Ux<sup>(k)</sup> either until convergence meaning an answer is found within a detemrmined delta or the maximum number of iterations were reached. L<sub>*</sub> is the inverse of the lower triangular matrix of the coefficient matrix and U is the strict upper triangular matrix of the coeffecient matrix. This algorithm comes in both a matrix version (demonstrated here) and an element-wisre formula.
