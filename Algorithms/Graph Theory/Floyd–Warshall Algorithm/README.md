# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is used to solve the All Pairs Shortest Path problem in a graph with positive and negative edge weights.
This algorithm takes a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
This algorithm works by comparing all the possible paths for each pair of vertices and updating the value if a better one is found until eventually the optimal values are reached.
The worst case runtime for this algorithm is O(|V|<sup>3</sup>).
