# Insertion Sort
The Insertion Sort is a simple in-place sorting algorithm. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N<sup>2</sup>) which means it is ineffecient overall. This algorithm works by taking an element from the unsorted data then finding where it belongs in the sorted list and placing it there. This process is repeated until there are no elements left in the unsorted data. Overall this sorting algorithm performs about the same as an selection sort and for larger arrays is almost always outperformed by divide and conquer algorithms such as mergesort and quicksort. Some benefits that this sort has over the selection sort and other divide and conquer sorts include the fact that it is effecient for already semi-sorted data sets, it does not change the relative order of elements and it can sort elements as it recieves them.
