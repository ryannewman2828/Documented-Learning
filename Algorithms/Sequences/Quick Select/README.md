# Quick Select
Quick Select is an algorithm that finds the k<sup>th</sup> smallest element in an unsorted list. Quickselect is very similar to the algorithm developed by the same guy called quicksort which works by picking a pivot and partitioning the list into two sublists based on this pivot. One key difference is that Quickselect only recurses on one side of the pivot instead of both. This algorithm has a worst (rare) case runtime of O(n<sup>2</sup>) while the average performance is O(n) making it quite effecient in practice. The algorithm works by selecting a random pivot and then moving all the elements smaller than the pivot to the left of it and all the elements greater to the right. It then recurses on the side of the list that holds the k<sup>th</sup> element and repeats this process until it is found.
