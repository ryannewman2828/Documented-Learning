# Merge Sort
The Merge Sort is a general purpose, effecient comparison based sorting algorithm. This algorithm is divide and conquer and works by recursively splitting the list into n sublists each containing a single element then recursively merges these sublists into sorted sublists until one final sorted list remains. The worst case runtime of this algorithm is O(n log n) which is the same as the best case for quicksort and much faster than the selection sort and the insertion sort. Merge sort is more effecient than the quick sort for lists that can be accessed sequentially and is also a stable sort meaning if two elements are equal they will appear in the same order.
