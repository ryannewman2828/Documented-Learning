# Quick Sort
The Quick Sort is an effecient divide and conquer sorting algorithm capable of outperforming heapsort and mergesort by two or three times if implemented well. This is a comparison sort meaning it compares the elements during the sort and it is not stable which means the order of equal elements is not perserved. This operates in-place on arrays meaning it uses a small amount of additional memory. The worst (rare) case performance for this sorting algorithm is O(n<sup>2</sup>) although the average performance is O(n log n). This algorithm works by picking a pivot point in the list. It then reorders the list so all elements less that the pivot come before the pivot and vice versa. Then a new pivot is picked for the list of numbers smaller than the pivot and numbers larger than the pivot respectively. This is repeated until the list is sorted.
