# Selection Sort
The Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N<sup>2</sup>) which means it is ineffecient overall but has its advantages in situations like when external memory is limited. The algorithm works by splitting the to be sorted list into 2 seperate lists, a sorted and unsorted list. The unsorted list is parsed to find the smallest, or largest depending on the sort, element which is then swapped with the element on the left of the unsorted list. This element now becomes the rightmost entry of the sorted list. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. Overall this sorting algorithm performs about the same as an insertion sort and for larger arrays is always outperformed by divide and conquer algorithms such as mergesort and quicksort.
