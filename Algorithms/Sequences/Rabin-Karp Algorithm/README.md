# Rabin-Karp Algorithm
The Rabin-Karp Algorithm is a string matching algorithm that uses the hash of the pattern to find it within the text. The average and best case runtime of this algorithm is O(n + m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern. The worst case of this algorithm is O(nm) which happens when all the sub-patterns in the text return the same hash as the pattern which means that the pattern is then checked character by character. This algorithm functions by first computing the hash of the pattern and then compares this to the hash of each of the sub-patterns of equal length in the text. When there is a match then the pattern and sub-pattern are compared character by character to check for a match.
