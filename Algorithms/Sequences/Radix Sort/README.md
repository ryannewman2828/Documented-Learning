# Radix Sort
The Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that groups items by integer keys which are selected by the position and value of the selected digit. The two classifications of the Radix Sort are the least significant digit radix sort and the most significant digit radix sort. The implementation shown in this example is the least significant digit radix sort. This sort works by starting at the least/most significant digit. The sort then, with position being maintained, puts the numbers in a bucket by the indexing the bucket by the digit. After putting the all the integers in the buckets, the buckets are then appended into a list. This process is then repeated by going through each of the digits, starting point and direction depends on the type of the sort. At the end of this process the appended list will be in sorted order. This sort has a time complexity of O(wn), sometimes w is considered a constant making the sort quite effecient but is still outperformed on average by divide and conquer sorting algorithms.
