# Count Sort
Count Sort is an integer based sorting algorithm for sorting a set of small integers. It functions by counting the number of occurences of distinct values and calculating where the first occurence of that value will appear in the sorted list. Once this value is inserted into its proper position the number in the array is incremented so that the next time this value is encountered it will be inserted in the adjacent position. The worst case runtime for this algorithm is O(n + k) where n is the length of the list and k is the maximum difference between the smallest and largest element. This algorithm works best for numbers where the variance is less than the total number of elements in the list making it useful as a subroutine for radix sort.
