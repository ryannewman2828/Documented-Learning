# Boyer-Moore Algorithm
The Boyer-Moore Algorithm is a string matching algorithm which works by preprocessing a bad character array and a good suffix array. The bad character rule defines the last position of every character in the pattern or -1 if its not present. The next step of the preprocessing is to compute the good suffix array. This defines the largest index for which the suffix, defined by the string at index i + 1 to the end of the pattern, appears earlier on in the pattern. This also can include any negative indices needed for an occurence of the suffix to appear. Both of these preprocessing steps can be completed in O(m) where m is the length of the pattern. The actual algorithm functions by matching at the end of the pattern to the front and on a mismatch consults both the preprocessed arrays and gets the minimum for the amount to shift. The runtime of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the text and it often performs better than the other string matching algorithms and works best on small patterns since the pattern is the thing being preprocessed.
