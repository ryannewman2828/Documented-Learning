# Binary Search
The Binary Search is a searching algorithm that finds the index of a target within a sorted array. The time complexity for this algorithm in the worst case is O(log n) and this algorithm allocates no new memory. The binary search tree data structure is based on the binary search. This algorithm works by continually halfing the list until the desired target is reached. The midpoint of the current list is checked, if the middle is the target then the index is returned, else the algorithm decides which half of the list the element resides in and makes that half list the new current list. This process is completed until either the target is found and has its index returned or the target is determined to not reside within the list.
