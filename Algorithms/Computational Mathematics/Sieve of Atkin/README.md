# Sieve of Atkin
The Sieve of Atkin is one of the Prime Number Sieves. This Sieve differs from the Sieve of Eratosthenes by first doing some preliminary work before crossing out numbers. The algorithm works by creating a result list initialized with 2, 3 and 5. A second sieve list is created with every positive integer being initially marked composite. A different flip is done depending on some modular arithmetic shown in the implementation. The numbers in the sieve list are then transferred to the result list. For every number transferred, the number is also squared and incremented then every multiple of that number is marked composite. The theoretical asymptotic complexity of this algorithm is (N / (log log N)). The Sieve of Atkin is one of the most efficient ways to find larger primes. This algorithm is used in conjunction with the Sieve of Eratosthenes in most modern prime number algorithms, this for the large and Eratosthenes when the numbers are smaller.
